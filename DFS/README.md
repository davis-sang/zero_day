# Depth First Search (DFS) Implementation in Python

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm using Python. The DFS algorithm is used to traverse or search through a graph data structure.

## Description

The script defines a `DepthFirstSearch` class which includes a method `dfs` to perform a depth-first traversal of a graph starting from a specified node. The graph is represented as an adjacency list using a dictionary in Python.

## Usage

1. **Class Definition:**
   - `DepthFirstSearch`: This class contains the DFS implementation.
   - `dfs(graph, start, visited=None)`: This method performs a DFS traversal on the provided graph starting from the specified node.

2. **Graph Representation:**
   - The graph is represented as a dictionary where the keys are nodes, and the values are lists of neighboring nodes.
